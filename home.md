## About

This course provides an in-depth exploration of the **principles and applications of modern language models**, including both **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Small Language Models (SLMs)**. Topics include the foundations of language models, their applications in **Education** and **Healthcare**, and their use in broader domains like customer service, legal tech, and software development. The course emphasizes the **design and implementation of agentic frameworks** for real-world challenges and critically examines the **ethical implications** of deploying language models in sensitive domains.
