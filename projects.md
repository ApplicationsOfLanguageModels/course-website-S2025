# Suggested Projects

> **Note**: The suggested projects are only starting points. They are not meant to be complete or novel ideas. You are expected to research these topics thoroughly, examine existing work, and brainstorm ways to innovate. Students are also encouraged to come up with their own ideas, using the suggestions as inspiration rather than strict guidelines.

> **Tip**: It is challenging to find completely novel ideas, especially when you are just starting. Shared tasks can be a great way to work on cutting-edge problems with provided datasets and well-defined objectives. If you're unsure about pursuing something entirely novel from scratch, shared tasks can help you build confidence and focus on methodological innovation.

## Education
- **Teacher Agent for K-12 Science/Mathematics/English**: Develop an AI agent capable of assisting teachers in delivering lessons, answering questions, and evaluating assignments.
- **Digital Twin for a Public Figure (Academic/Scientist)**: Create a personalized virtual profile that simulates a public figure like Andrew Ng or Yann LeCun.
- **Digital Twin for a Learner**: Create a personalized virtual profile that simulates a learner's cognitive and behavioral patterns.
- **Accountable Talk Chatbot**: Design a chatbot that fosters meaningful and accountable discussions in educational settings.
- **LLMs for Language Education**: Prototype a system for teaching classical literature elements (e.g., meter or glossing) in languages like Sanskrit or Telugu.

## Cognition
- **CTS (Cognitive Task Analysis)**: Build an agentic framework and workflow to facilitate the cognitive task analysis process.
- **Short-Term Memory Aid**: Develop an application to assist individuals in retaining and recalling short-term memory information effectively.

## Healthcare
- **AI-Powered Nursing Assistant for Rural Clinics**: Build an AI-powered assistant to support nurses in rural clinics with triage, documentation, and basic diagnosis.
- **VitalKids**: An image-based malnutrition monitoring system to assess the health of children from their photographs.
- **Mental Health and Well-being Companion**: Implement an empathetic conversational agent for mental health support, offering mindfulness exercises, mood tracking, and coping strategies tailored to seniors' experiences and challenges. Inspired by [Elliq](https://elliq.com/).

## Multilingual
- **Multilingual Content Moderation Using LLMs**: Investigate hate speech and related problems using multilingual datasets and compare various LLMs and APIs.
- **Benchmarking LLMs for Multi-Label, Multi-Lingual Text Classification**: Develop benchmarks for multilingual and multi-label problems using LLMs.
