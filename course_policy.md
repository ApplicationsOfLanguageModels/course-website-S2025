## Teaching and Learning Methodology

This course is designed to help learners understand the principles, applications, and implications of language models. The course follows a **problem-based and project-based learning methodology**, where students will be engaged in solving real-world challenges using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Small Language Models (SLMs). The teaching strategy includes **interactive lectures, tutorials, hands-on workshops**, and **guest lectures** from experts in academia and industry. **Thursdays** are specifically reserved for tutorials and guest lectures, ensuring students have opportunities to learn from domain experts and explore cutting-edge applications.

## Use of AI Tools

Students are **encouraged to use AI tools** like ChatGPT, Co-Pilot, Cursor, Codium, and other LLM-based tools for their projects. However:
- Clearly mention **what tools** were used and **how** they were utilized in the final presentation.  
- Be mindful of the **limitations of AI tools**, as demonstrated in class. Tools can sometimes produce incorrect or misleading results.  
- While tools are enablers, **understanding the underlying concepts** is critical for effectively leveraging these tools.  

Bottom line: Feel free to use AI tools, but use them **wisely and responsibly**.
