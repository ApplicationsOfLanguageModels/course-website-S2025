## Teaching and Learning Methodology

This course is designed to help learners understand the principles, applications, and implications of language models. The course follows a **problem-based and project-based learning methodology**, where students will be engaged in solving real-world challenges using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Small Language Models (SLMs). The teaching strategy includes **interactive lectures, tutorials, hands-on workshops**, and **guest lectures** from experts in academia and industry. **Thursdays** are specifically reserved for tutorials and guest lectures, ensuring students have opportunities to learn from domain experts and explore cutting-edge applications.

## Zero Tolerance on Plagiarism

This course requires students to submit assignments, participate in activities, give exams, and work on group projects. **Any form of cheating or plagiarism will result in a score of "0"** for the specific task (assignment, activity, or project). Severe cases may lead to a failing grade (**"F"**) for the course. Students are expected to adhere to high ethical standards in their work.

## Use of AI Tools

Students are **encouraged to use AI tools** like ChatGPT, Co-Pilot, Cursor, Codium, and other LLM-based tools for assignments and projects. In fact, most projects will inherently require the use of LLMs. However:
- Clearly mention **what tools** were used and **how** they were utilized in the submission report.  
- Be mindful of the **limitations of AI tools**, as demonstrated in class. Tools can sometimes produce incorrect or misleading results.  
- While tools are enablers, **understanding the underlying concepts** is critical for effectively leveraging these tools.  

Bottom line: Feel free to use AI tools, but use them **wisely and responsibly**.

## Extra Days and Soft Deadlines

1. Each team will have **7 extra days (in total)** that can be used at their discretion for project submissions. These extra days allow students to submit projects past the deadline **without incurring any penalty**. Extra days can only be used for projects.  

2. Every project will have a **soft deadline** followed by a **hard deadline** (7 days after the soft deadline).  
   - If a student submits a project after the soft deadline but before the hard deadline, they will incur **penalties for each additional day** unless they use their extra days quota.  
   - For example, if the **soft deadline** is February 3, 2025, the **hard deadline** will be February 10, 2025. Students with sufficient extra days can delay submissions until February 10 without penalty. If a student exhausts their extra days earlier (e.g., by February 5), penalties will apply for submissions made between February 6–10.  

3. **No submissions** will be accepted after the hard deadline.

---

## Grading Policy

1. Students may request a re-evaluation of their grade **up to 1 week after the grade is posted**. After that, no requests for re-evaluation will be entertained.  
2. There will be **no make-up quizzes, activities, or exams** unless prior permission is granted.  
3. If a student cannot submit a project on time, they can use the **extra days** and **soft deadline** policy. **No submissions will be accepted after the hard deadline**, and **no email requests for deadline extensions will be entertained**.  
4. While project grades are assigned to the entire team, individual contributions will be assessed using multiple mechanisms. A student's grade for a project can be **adjusted up or down by up to 50%** based on their contribution.

## Grade Distribution

| Component                                | Weightage |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------- |
| **Project (Proposal, Prototype, Presentation)** | 70%       |
| **Class Participation and Activities**   | 30%       |

**Note:** 
- Bonus points (up to 5%) may be awarded during projects for outstanding performance.  
- Bonus points will be added to the total course grade.  
- The instructor reserves the right to make minor modifications to this distribution based on course progress.

## Tutorials and Guest Lectures

Thursdays are dedicated to **tutorials** and **guest lectures**, providing students with an opportunity to gain insights from **industry experts and academics** working at the forefront of language model research and applications. These sessions are designed to complement the course content and broaden students’ understanding of the field.
