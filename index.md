# Applications of Language Models

Applications of Language Models is an exciting, hands-on course designed to bring the power of language models like GPT, BERT, and others to life. Forget traditional lectures—this course is all about diving into the practical, cutting-edge world of natural language processing (NLP). Whether it’s building smarter chatbots, summarizing endless documents, or crafting personalized recommendations, this course focuses on solving real-world problems with modern AI tools.

We’ll cover the essentials like pre-training, fine-tuning, and prompt engineering, but also dive deeper into advanced topics like efficient model optimization (think quantization and distillation), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and making sense of APIs and agent frameworks. It’s a mix of structured lectures, flipped classrooms, and plenty of time for self-driven or collaborative projects.

What’s the endgame? By the time you finish, you’ll have developed practical expertise, built something awesome, and maybe even contributed to research or shared task competitions. This is your playground for innovation—let’s make something amazing together!
